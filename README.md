# ACCIDENT-PRONE-AREA-DETECTION
This project aims to identify and predict accident-prone areas on roads using machine learning and spatial data analysis. The primary objective is to enhance road safety by providing insights into high-risk zones, allowing authorities to take preventive measures such as improving signage, installing speed breakers, or redesigning road layouts.
